Well, my daughter, who just turned 11, thought that it looked ""awesome"". So, we purchased it for her birthday. Boy, did we score big. We are having so much fun with it. We do her hair now at least twice a week. All of her girlfreinds can't wait to come over and try it. It does take some getting used to. If you want the hair strand completely covered with the colorful string, you really have to move slow, but not too slow as it will be bumpy. Other than a steady hand, you don't need anything else (except a pair of scissors).

I am now searching for a mobile that spins for at least 8 - 10 minutes, no matter what it looks like! It also didn't mount right on our crib (sleigh type/4 in 1)no matter where we tried.

B0009MYNJI,Cristalle Eau de Parfum for Women by Chanel,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,7/8,5.0,1128902400,"Many years ago, I was browsing through Sacks Fifth Ave., looking for a fresh, spring/summer scent that would suit me. The saleswoman was extremely helpful, and spent some time discussing various perfumes with me, as well as spritzing different paper strips with sample scent, rather than my arm. I preferred light, transparent woodsy scents - subtle. Chanel had just launched a new perfume, in 1974, which combined the fresh, fruity tang of lemon from Italy, light spring floral notes of Honeysuckle and Water Hyacinth, and pulled it all together with the woodsy charm of Vetiver and oakmoss.Vetiver has a delightful smoky woodsy fragrance which is frequently blended with geranium and jasmine. It is a tall, dense, wild grass with long narrow leaves and a strand of underground white, yellow and brown roots and is sought after for its calming, protective, soothing and uplifting characteristics. Vetiver can be found in Java, Haiti, Japan, Indonesia and South India.I find it goes deliciously well with the above ingredients and leaves one feeling clean, fresh, intimate and very sexy. There is no astringent smell or feel to Cristalle, unlike many ""fresh scents,"" nor is it too heady or heavy. Cristalle is a stimulating fragrance and an excellent perfume for day wear, especially in warm weather and for sports. I also wear it on warm evenings as I prefer the crisp, woodsy scent to the sweeter flowery ones in the heat. Because it is so subtle, it is ideal for the workplace also, used sparingly.Chanel relaunched Cristalle in 1993 with a richer floral blend in the eau de parfum concentration with a slightly fruiter chypre base. The changes did not impact my opinion at all. It is still an outstanding fragrance, one of my very few favorites.I have worn ""Cristalle"" for thirty years now, and it has carried me through various life phases beautifully and smoothly. An absolute feel good perfume! ENJOY!PS - I just noted that one of the other reviewers mentions that Chris Noth (""Law & Order,"" ""Sex in the City""), is Wowed by Cristalle! Makes sense, I am Wowed by Chris Noth!!JANA",beauty,fragrance,women s,toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons

It is helpful in teaching cause and effect even before your baby can use it as a shape sorter. By just kicking or pushing it with a block or two inside the sorter will play music or make sounds. Soon, however, your baby will learn to take the blocks out and play with them. These peek-a-blocks are a great in and of themeselves! With the large opening on the top of the sorter babies can begin by putting in and taking out the blocks. As they mature, they can advance to using the shape holes on the sides. Finally, there is a puzzle on the bottom of the sorter where toddlers can learn to but the blocks into their matching shaped wells.

Never falls over when on a flat surface like it's supposed to be. I hear this toy numerous times a day! Sometimes my son will knock him over on purpose to hear him say ""Elmo fell down, a little help please"". I agree that there isn't much educational value that comes with this toy but not all toys have to be educational. Kids learn through all types of play. Actually, music in itself is educational. New studies suggest that even just listening to music may improve learning, memory, logic and general creativity.

It isn't. (Nivea lotion works wonders however).One thing I noticed is on a FULL charge, if you use the shaver right after unplugging it from the wall, it works AWESOME. The next day, not so much (the motor sounds like it is going slower). The day after that, a bit slower, and usually within 4-5 days it is struggling to keep me clean shaven. So, I'd recommend this shaver to use at your house, and keep plugged in all the time, and you will not be disappointed, it's a great shaver.

But that was acceptable with the first one we because of the light show and music. My son absolutely loooves the light show on the ceiling! But then that quit working after 5 months. Changed the bulb, took it apart - projector just would not turn on any more. So we exchanged it for a replacement (no problem at Babys R Us) which the light show again just suddenly quit working. This time only after 1 month. I think we'll take it back and get a monitor only and some other light/music thing for the crib.Also - the turning on of the music & projector was a pain - have to constantly flip each off/on; off/on - probably what causes it to quit working.

B000284X58,InteracTV DVD System Compilation In-Pack,A2A45C7PALQW5D,5/7,1.0,1129420800,"I did my research and read all the reviews on Fisher Price's InteracTV. I did take pause when I read a number of reviews that complained about compatability issues and such, but I figured that there was always some idiot out there who didn't follow the directions! So when amazon ran a special on the system, I grabbed one. Then I spent 30 minutes trying to make the darn thing work! I read the directions, looked up the code for my dvd unit and proceeding with the setup, which seemed quite elementary. Elementary that is until the code didn't work. Never worry, Fisher Price listed a solution to this problem; unfortunately that didn't work either, and Fisher Price has the nerve to let their employees have Saturday off - so no help from customer service! Next I tried our second dvd player, and the code took the first time, but the test card would not work. The player kept reading different screens from the ones that I placed in it, and I grew increasing frustrated. Eventually I got through the setup process. I tried the included disc to see if my soon to be three year old son would enjoy it. He has only recently started to show an interest in watching tv, loves pushing buttons (what toddler doesn't!), and I thought this would be a great game for him to play that let him see shows while interacting with them, not just sitting there like a couch potato. Well, it starts out like a tv episode, then the screen freezes (which would probably set my son off), and a picture of the controller appears with the main character asking a question for the child to answer with the controller. On the episode that I played, Elmo was very hard to understand. When I answered incorrectly, I was startled that Elmo said something to the effect of ""NO - that's not what Elmo was thinking about"", in a somewhat abrupt tone. When I tried to answer differently, I had to wait for Elmo to finish with his speech before it would even recognize my answer. So the kid could answer correctly, but never know it because Elmo is still telling him that he is wrong from before. I was incrediably disappointed by the slowness of the unit, and its lack of responsiveness. I rried one more question and gave up before I died from boredom. This toy would not pass muster with my son, and would likely be thrown in record time. I repackaged the thing (no small task mind you), and took it back to the store (amazon was sold out when I placed my order), where the customer service lady was not at all surprised to have it returned.

Our new baby sleeps great in it, and it promises many months of use. It is well-made of quality materials. For new moms, it allows quick access to the baby as well as ease of checking on the baby frequently, while in bed. My only complaints are that there is no access to the storage space underneath the bed (when used as a co-sleeper) other than to remove the mattress. It would be more user-friendly if there was a zipper or door to access this area - it would be great for storing blankets, diapers, etc. Also, if you purchase the canopy to cover the co-sleeper, be aware that there is only one zipper opening which makes it difficult to get baby in and out of the co-sleeper during the day (depending on which direction the zipper faces if the co-sleeper is used as directed up against the bed).",baby products,nursery,furniture,toys games,vehicles remote control,play trains railway sets

His crown is a very nice touch, and gives his large look a more kingly twist.His vehicle mode is really cool, though a little awkward for his huge size.

We take it out to our hottub and can watch her too.The color isn't too great on it but it is great anyway.The only thing I wish is that the screen wouldn't get too hot while it stayed on and when it is running on batteries that the you could get the screen to constantly stay on.I wish I could also buy another handheld too to keep in another part of the house.,baby products,safety,monitors,baby products,safety,gates doorways

This way you can clean it in case it gets dirty but it's so hard to put back together that I wouldn't remove it. If it gets dirty just clean around it.

B0009V1YS2,Farouk CHI GF1539 Turbo Big 2 Inch Ceramic Flat Iron Hair Straightener,A2NQ602MJ1VP09,182/189,5.0,1129939200,"CHI manufactures this 2"" size, and 1"" and 0.7"" widths in the same line also. My first inclination was to buy the 2"" size - that would make the process faster, right? Well, I was advised and found out to be true that bigger is not better in this situation, for reasons stated below. So while I highly recommend the CHI Turbo straightener, I would recommend the smaller widths unless you know for a fact that you prefer the larger plates. The following section is my review for the 0.7"" (which is mistakenly advertised as 0.07""), which I think is helpful even if you decide on the 2"" model, so forgive my copy-and-paste.I was suspect of the need for ""ceramic ions"" and ""far infrared technology"", but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it. You don't need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product. This was a case of ""you get what you pay for""! It is lightweight and ergonomic, heats up almost immediately, has a slider bar for varying heat from 176-356F (80-180C), and velvety felt that protects you from burns (also allows me to get closer to my ears and scalp without getting burned). The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage). Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:1) size matters - smaller size is better - it's more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results.2) not all ceramic is created equal - there are solid ceramic plates or plates COATED with ceramic that are cheaper. the ceramic layer on the coated plates can peel off and is supposedly damaging to your hair (not to mention your product is ruined).So yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.",beauty,hair care,styling tools,toys games,action toy figures,figures

I started with the wooden Eddie Bauer because I liked the way it looked and it matched my decor. I returned it because it didn't recline, the height wasn't adjustable, it was hard and seemed uncomfortable, and it had no wheels. Plus, it didn't fold for storage. Next, I purchased the Evenflo Discovery High Chair. I loved most of the features (it reclined, the height was adjustable, it was a little more comfortable than the Eddie Bauer, it had wheels, and it folded for storage) except the seat was too deep and my child who is in the 95th percentile for height could barely see over the top. The activity center was way too loud and the graphics could not be seen by the baby. On that note they couldn't really be seen in a normally lit kitchen by anyone. The seat would never sit all the way up and I had to prop a pillow behind my baby at every mealtime which was ridiculous. When I returned it I was told there was no defect that is just how the chair is made. I doesn't keep your baby straight up. Finally, I brought my child to the store and sat him in the high chairs I was considering (below $100). I was so happy with the Baby Trend Palm Tree High Chair. It had ALL OF THE FEATURES I was looking for and it was super comfortable. Plus, it had shoulder straps, which when worn loosely added extra safety without restricting movement.

Now, supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us. First of all, the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on. Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside, it won't keep the heating latch engaged. I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes, the bottle was still ice cold!

It is nice to have the bag, but watch your child to make sure they don't stick their head in it, like my son tries to do. It will fit over his head down to his shoulders, and he has a big head in the 97th percentile. There are only a few interesting parts...the two eye pieces and the part of a train piece on wheels...How much use is it to use it as a train with one train piece? And most of the blocks can't be used on the train piece, so it is just a piece of plastic on wheels. The house piece that looks liek a roof is pretty useless. These are easier for a 1 year old to put together, but they don't stay together as good as the Lego's quattro blocks.I would use the money to Legos...they have much more chunkier pieces that can actually be used to be creative and build things other than astraight tower, and they lock together a lot better...meaning the pieces not falling off.",toys games,building toys,stacking blocks,toys games,action toy figures,figures

I suggest you go to place with a good return policy like target and try several out before you find the one that works well.

It comes in the trademark Fekkai tube (easy to squeeze with wet hands).Since my hair is fine and fly-away it works best for me if I rub a small amount between my palms on towel dried hair and stroke through.

Much better than the dark roast Senseo product. You need to be careful to center the pod in the single pod holder and to tap it down a bit. Otherwise, the final product can be a bit watery. It is not difficult to do--you just need to pay a little attention when inserting the pod.I have never tried to make 2 4-ounce cups sequentially as did the previous reviewer, but it does not surprise me that the second cup from the same pod was weaker. It is fairly logical to me that the strongest coffee would be the cup made on fresh grounds (just like a regular drip coffee maker). If you make a single 8 oz. cup or 2 4-ounce cups AT THE SAME TIME, the quality is very good.The best pod, in my opinion is the Kona coffee pod, also available on amazon.

We received 1 SwaddleMe as a baby shower gift and within 2 days of my son's birth had to go out and get 2 more so that we always had a clean one on hand. Swaddling is so much easier and so much more secure with this, compared to a receiving blanket. At about 3 weeks our son began to kick and swirm in the SwaddleMe so we stopped using it because we thought he didn't like it anymore. Big mistake! After trial and error and talking to the pediatrician we learned his kicking and squirming was due to fussying about going to bed not the SwaddleMe. Once we resumed using it at around 6 weeks, he slept longer and better because he wouldn't wake himself up with his startling movements, which most if not all babies do at that age. Needless to say once we started using it again he was quickly sleeping 8-9 hours straight at night, about 2 hours more than he was without the SwaddleMe.The cotton SwaddleMe is not as warm as the fleece one, so depending on the temperature outside and in the house, we use whichever one is most appropriate.",baby products,nursery,unknown,baby products,safety,gates doorways

A few months ago, we purchased a few of the economy-sized packs, as we usually do, from our local BRU. The material was changed on the area that the tabs secure to! I was disappointed because the superior ""holding power"" was the reason we always chose Pampers over Huggies (which we get more and better coupons for). I contacted customer service through the web site, and was informed it was a glitch in their manufacturing process, which was corrected. They were kind enough to send some coupons for free diapers. HOWEVER, the next few packages we bought...same thing. I bought Huggies for about 6 weeks, and decided last week to try Pampers again. Surely, the ""duds"" were out of circulation by that time. Nope! Bought the box, and again...same problem. Is this problem only in the Northeastern Ohio area? Or, I wonder, did the customer service representative fib just to appease me when the diapers have been permanently changed?THREE MORE E-MAILS AND I GOT TWO RESPONSES FROM THE ""PAMPERS TEAM"". ONE STATING IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHICH STORES STILL HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PACKAGES (HMMM...MY UNDERSTANDING WAS MANUFACTURERS COULD TRACK THIS BY CERTAIN NUMBERS).

THE OTHER ""PAMPERS TEAM MEMBER"" REPLIED THAT THE TEAM WASN'T AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, SHE WOULD INFORM THEM, AND INSINUATED IT WAS, PERHAPS, DUE TO SOMETHING ON MY PART (HAND LOTION, ETC.). THE STRIP THAT THE TABS ADHERE TO IS NOT AS FUZZY, HOW CAN THAT BE CAUSED BY HAND LOTION/WRONG SIZE/ETC.?THEY ARE BOTH FOLLOWING UP BY MAIL, SINCE E-MAIL ""LIMITS"" WHAT THEY CAN DO.

When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor. Big Mistake! The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.Why you say? To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings. In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads. The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.By the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost. You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after ""cleaning.""The bottom line",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,toys games,action toy figures,figures

B0009XLVEC,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,A17CEHUSQOYJ7G,5/12,2.0,1130803200,"There are various types of head collar on the market today, all designed to do roughly the same thing. They discourage your dog from pulling by making pulling intensely uncomfortable, and they give you enough physical leverage to control your dog if he does decide to pull.What could be wrong with that? Well firstly, dogs really don't like head collars. I have never ever seen a dog happily wear a Gentle Leader on the first attempt - not suprising since the device applies pressure on the sensitive bridge of the nose. I have, however, seen many dogs cry, wail, claw their faces, and/or just shut down and miserably refuse when first introduced to a head collar. It is true that you can eventually teach most dogs to accept these devices (dogs are very tolerant animals), but why not just invest that time into teaching your dog to walk politely on a leash in a regular collar?Secondly, this device only works while it is on the dog. In other words, it doesn't actually teach the dog anything - if you take the halti off, the dog will start to pull again. Not exactly a long term solution - unless you want to keep your dog on a Gentle Leader for the rest of his life.So, if your dog pulls, what do you do?

She doesn't want to just dial anything-she's old enough to know the difference.The most disappointing part...the voices do NOT come out of the handset. She was (and I was too) expecting to 'talk' to the pricesses using the phone like a real phone. My older daughter has a barbie phone that works like a real answering machine and phone and the voice comes out of the handset!Don't waste your money on this if your child is 4 or older-it's too babyish",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown,toys games,games,board games

It caused me considerable discomfort and was unsightly. I've tried so many different topical ointments prescribed by physicians but none brought it under control. I heard about Freederm through a friend and started using it. I gave up after one month because I didn't see any improvement. My friend told me to stick with it for a couple of months and the eczema would clear up. I did just that and for the first time in years, I have been pretty much eczema free for about two months in a row. I put the cream on every night and if I start to see any sign of eczema returning, I start using the cream 2-3 times a day and it always clears it up. I would recommend this to any one who suffers from eczema.",beauty,skin care,body,toys games,baby toddler toys,music sound

After using the razor for a month, I have yet to receive a close shave without irritation. The razor heads are so large, that they really don't contour to my face at all. Additionally, the excessive amount of openings on the razor head guard only lead to more irritation, not a quick, smooth shave as advertised. I also find it somewhat awkward to use the pop up trimmer. It comes up from the rear, which means you have to hold the razor backward to use it. If I want to invert the trimmer to buzz up underneath my sideburns, I have to hold the trimmer in place otherwise it will fold back down and close.Needless to say, I am sending this razor back to Norelco and purchasing the Cool Skin 7735X - an updated model of the razor that gave me a close, smooth, painless shave for almost 2 years.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats

B00005V9NV,"Philips AVENT Disposable Nursing Pads, 100 Count",AUGG4ZT22P2WF,3/3,5.0,1131580800,"I've tried several different brands and styles of disposable breast pads and found these to be the best of the bunch.Because they are thicker than others I've tried, they are easier to slip in and out of a nursing bra without them getting folded over and/or bunched up. I'm rather large breasted (especially now that I'm nursing!) so it was a challenge to be discrete while messing with other more flimsy breast pads. (Its enough of a challenge to do up a nursing bra with one hand while juggling an infant in the other without worrying about your nursing pads getting bunched up!!)I've never had a problem with them showing through my clothes. Since I've been nursing, however, I've found that wearing shirts that are looser makes nursing while I'm out easier and more discrete. I have never had a problem with the nursing pads showing through the few shirts I have that are slightly clingy and/or made of thin material.These are also very absorbant. I've rarely had any problem with leaking and found that often I could wear a single pair for a full day. Because I could wear them so much longer than other brands (which often needed to be replaced several times a day), I saved money by not having to buy a new box every couple of weeks. (In the beginning, a 100 ct. box lasted me about 5 weeks. Now that my daughter is 5 months old, a box lasts several months.)The fact that they do not have plastic on the outside was nice too because it allows your nipples to breathe. They are also very soft - a HUGE plus especially when you are just starting to breastfeed and your nipples are sore.I will definitely use these with my next baby!!!",health personal care,baby child care,personal care,toys games,building toys,building sets

If WP addressed the issues of poor battery characteristics and unacceptable reliability, this product would be a winner.

The package advertises that it ""eliminates need for blankets and jackets,"" so I expected it to have some insulation; however, it does not. It is the same thickness as a fleece pullover or blanket. I think it is warm enough to use alone on coolish spring or fall days, but you will definately still need outerwear for your baby for winter. In fact, when I am using this, I cover it with the ""boot"" that came with my stroller in order to have another layer of protection against wind.That said, my son seems very comfortable in the Bundle Me when I take him on walks in the stroller.

Breastfeeding wasn't ""working"" for me either for about the first four weeks, but now I am so glad that I stuck with it.I had first tried an electric pump that I rented from the hospital and what I didn't like about it was the rhythmic pumping motion. It was really hard on my nipples. With the Isis pump, I can squeeze the handle a few times and hold it down while the milk just flows out. I control the pumping motion. It's great and my nipples aren't contantly rubbing on the sides of the plastic.This pump is also easy to take apart, clean (I use the microwave sterilizer) and put back together.

I loved the litle grill on the back and the entire thing was really cute. I bought it last night and my husband and I spent a few hours putting it together.It's awful. The door for the dishwasher won't stay closed, the door for the stove won't open without a lot of force and it makes this awful noise when it does. The upper cabinet doors are extremely hard to open (almost causing the whole thing to tip over when you try) and the fridge and microwave door stick when closed---if they close at all. The canopy is almost impossible to get together and the grill cover is a flimsy piece of plastic---not the chunky type plastic little tikes is known for.I am very disappointed. I usually don't have many problems with little tikes toys (we own many) but this product seems very cheaply made.If you do buy it, put the doors in place first (in the directions it's one of the last set of steps) to see if they are going to stick/open/close without problems. Putting the doors on will not affect the rest of the setup but at least you'll know if you want to continue or return it.I'll be returning this product later and exhanging it for either the Step 2 dream kitchen or the little tikes cook and clean kitchen.

They would work well with any home. The reclining feature is wonderful. We used this feature more than I thought we would. We bought this chair when our son turned 4 months old. He could sit up on his own, but only for a short while, so when we would feed him, we could slightly recline the seat. This made it so much more comfortable for him (and us!). The height of the chair adjusts...again another feature I didn't think that we would use, but we have taken much advantage of that bell and whistle! And of course, wheels. Trust me, wheels are a must have! In the very beginning, the tray seemed a little high, I guess, but absolutely no higher than the other chairs at BRU (I research everything before I buy, and I researched chairs on- line for weeks before going to the store for test runs). The fabric does get messy, but I think that has a lot to do with my messy eater. Some people complain about not being able to dry it, but that hasn't been a problem with me either. I throw it in the wash after dinner, lie it on the ironing board before bed, and it's dry in the morning. Please don't let washing the pad be an issue, because this chair is GREAT! My son is 1 year old now, we have washed the cover once every one or two weeks (as needed), and it looks perfect still.

Also in wafer form it is more effective as it combines with saliva to react positively in the gastric tract. [DGL Wafers]DGL VS. CIMETIDINE:Studies have shown that in comparison to ""Cimetidine"", the DGL wafers worked slower but effected more of a healing action against peptic ulcers. They used 1 DGL wafer before each meal in the clinical trials.What is Glycyrrhizin?It is what makes Licorice incredibly beneficial and potentially dangerous. In a nutshell, it can aggravate hypertension and edema. If you are looking for gastric tract relief, forget about Glycyrrhizin.ABOUT BRANDS:I have used ""Now"", ""Swanson"", ""Enzymatic Therapy"" and ""Nature's Way"" with roughly equal results.

But leaks take their toll if the bath takes a long time or you don't clean up quickly.After pulling it apart to inspect the seal, I noticed that on one side, the seal was not aligned with the lower edge and probably this is the cause of the leak.

I think my boy is somewhat frustrated by the delay.The coloring books are only treated with the CW chemicals inside the lines of the pics, which is kind of weird... you can't elaborate on a picture, or even sign your name (unless you use another kind of marker)All in all the markers are better than the paints... the plain paper is better than the coloring books... but I can't say I am terribly impressed with this product. I think it is a good travel item, though... so your kid can't mark up property belonging to anyone else... it just doesn't seem to replace the fun of coloring with regular markers or crayons 100%.

My 3 yr old daughter wanted this soooo very badly for her birthday so of course the little princess got her princess castle. While I was impressed with the beautiful detail of the castle itself I was suprised with the size. The castle itself appears to be a good size but the inside is small and really there is no room to play with the dolls. My daughter has had it for 3 days and really has not played all that much with it. Santa is bringing her the loving family twin dollhouse for x-mas and that I think she will enjoy more since there is all the accesories that you can put inside the house and can actually play inside the house with the dolls P.S.

This car fit all of the basic needs for the starter RC I was looking for. I have been very pleased with this purchase.It has some definate pros and cons. The pros are that it is very durable. My experience is that the battery life was pretty good. A key factor, like many other toys, is turning it off when my son is done playing with it. It is also very durable as far as the rough play of little boy. My son loves the clown remote and easily uses the buttons. I love the fact that it fits into the top. We haven't lost it yet. It is a pretty easy car to manuver. Some cons are it is recommended for inside use only, which caused some frustrations at first. It also runs poorly on carpet and has no reverse.Overall this is a quality toy. If you are looking for a starter RC I would highly recommend this toy.

B00000IWI1,Connect Four,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,3/4,4.0,1132963200,"Traditionally Connect Four is played with two players for children aged seven and older. I initially purchased this game with my seven-year old in mind since he enjoyed Checkers and Bingo.Actually the oldest did not show any interest in Connect Four and only utilized it a few times so this worked out well having at least one child play with the game. In the past I have purchased toddler type products for my younger son due to his disability and just overlooked the beginning age requirement for Connect Four. Since we keep the game in the box the only set-up needed is to slide the end supports onto the slots. They have Connect Four on the outside part so it is easy to know which side to face inward. The retaining lever stays secure and is fastened by sliding over the yellow slot underneath.The grid contains seven rows with six round slots to fit the checkers. There are twenty-one black and red checkers with the logo, Connect Four imprinted on one side and MB on the other. The retaining lever is not locked into place until both side end supports are in position. Before the first player drops a checker into a slot check the lever to make sure it is secured, otherwise the checkers will drop right through to the ground.When playing with two players the choice of red or black is made and each player takes the collection into a pile. Each player drops a checker into any slot in the grid and alternates with the other player, otherwise known as your opponent. They alternate turns until one has mastered four in a row in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. This became confusing for my older son because there are six in a column or row and he preferred to get all six to be a winner. There are no points to accumulate in Connect Four and to play another game you can either slide the retaining lever and let loose all the checkers or turn it over and dump them all back into the box.This has worked well for my non verbal son.",toys games,games,board games,toys games,action toy figures,figures

B0000DH5TU,Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,A3AUBZIZJNZQ4R,0/0,1.0,1133049600,"These monitors were quite possibly the worst pieces of equipment we have ever purchased. We put up with them for two weeks before caving in and purchasing the slightly more expensive (but much better) Sony model.I'm glad to see that some people have had success with these monitors, but they failed miserably for us. We live in a 3-story house, and our bedroom is adjacent to our son's room (less than 15 feet away). More often than not, the receiver encountered so much interference that it was only possible to hear our newborn with the receiver volume cranked up to about 75%. Even then, there was so much noisy static on the line that it was impossible to hear all but his loudest noises. The monitor also emitted a constant buzzing sound loud enough to wake a sleeping giant, even at low volume. Yes, our home does also include a set of 5.8 gHz cordless phones and a 2.4 gHz wireless LAN, but neither is a frequency even remotely close to that of these monitors, so they weren't the culprit. In fact, I'm fairly certain that these monitors use the ultra-cheap FM family band so common in cheapo walkie-talkies, because we could occasionally hear conversations from travelers in cars and even radio stations.We tried every possible configuration of channels to get better performance from these things, but had no success. In contrast, the Sony model that we purchased is crystal clear with zero interference--and even if there WAS interference, the Sony offers 27 channels instead of the paltry 2 the Fisher Price features. The one redeeming feature of these monitors is the fact that they offer a visible bar that fluctuates when your child makes noise, so as a non-audio monitor I guess they're fine.If you're relying on these things to warn you if your child is awake, however, look elsewhere and be willing to spend a bit more cash, because you're definitely rolling the dice by trying to save a couple bucks with these. Fisher Price makes great toys, but when it comes to electronics, they should leave it to the pros.",baby products,safety,monitors,toys games,games,board games

Board Game,AQSU58L0QIE2G,9/9,4.0,1133222400,"Debate This! is a game of debating, but not your average high-school debate team topics.The game is best played with three teams of two or more players. At the beginning of the game, one player is chosen to act as judge. While the judge does not get to debate, they do have the hilarious job of choosing who wins each debate.The topics are generally not heavy ones, in fact, quite the opposite. If it is not your turn, you don't have any say in which side of the argument you'll be arguing. This leads to some hysterical moments. I found myself arguing that the U.S. government DOES have undeniable proof that aliens exist, that if the judge of the game were a character from the Wizard of Oz, he would be Glinda the Good Witch, that The Partridge Family would be a more fun family to be a member of than the Brady Bunch, and that ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" was the worst possible song to have stuck in your head.The downside of the game is that people with chronic giggling problems (yours truly) sometimes have a difficult time debating, as they are too busy laughing.

A few months after it came to market I decided to try it out.For over 6 months I've been using these batteries in our toothbrushes, cameras, electric screwdriver, remote controls, two-way radios, CD players, anything that uses AA or AAA. The product exceeds my greatest expectations.Disregard the high cost comments. This should be viewed as an investment. I can get the batteries locally for about $3.45 each. Figuring 25 cents for an alkaline battery you recover the cost after 14 recharges. 120 recharges and you've paid for the charger.My family loves this thing. It completely changes your view of battery operated appliances. Not one of these batteries has gone bad. I have a pocket radio that I use constantly. One charge lasts over a week. The batteries do not die suddenly. When in doubt I can top off the battery in less than 15 minutes.We are never out of batteries and we have an entirely new mindset now that it doesn't cost anything to discharge a battery. At the same time we aren't throwing batteries in the trash can.It is our view that a battery that costs 25 cents plus shipping and handling per use is far more expensive than one that costs 15 minutes.",health personal care,household supplies,household batteries,baby products,feeding,breastfeeding

Once the baby get's too heavy you really start to compromise your back and shoulders. If you are into baby wearing then this will only last you very little and you will soon have to research other carriers.The Good Stuff:1. The carrier part is nice and thick and provides lots of support for the baby's back and head.2. Easy to put on and take off without help.The Bad Stuff:1. Provides no back support for the person doing the carrying.2. In order to get some back support you must tighten the lumbar very very tight to the point you can't breath!!3. The shoulder staps are NOT sufficiently padded. The shoulder pain becomes unbearable after 1 hr for a 10 pound baby.4. Forward facing - the fold down head support flaps back into the baby's face. You have to constantly fold it down.5. Since the baby's legs dangle in front. You CANNOT sit comfortabley.Bottom line - if you plan on wearing your baby for more than an hour at a time or past 2-3 months this is a complete waste of money. If you are looking to use it only on light errands and plan on transfering baby to a stroller in 2-3 months then it's ok (althought still expensive for such little use) After some extensive research and trying several carriers I ended up with the Ergo Baby Carrier. All the baby's weight is on the hips (the way nature intended!)not the shoulders. Not to mention the shoulders are very padded. And even now that my daughter is 14 months I can still carry her with no problem and no pain.,baby products,gear,backpacks carriers,toys games,building toys,building sets

Joe Valor vs. Venom Green Shirt Infantry Division 6-Pack,A3SLDH24IA40C0,1/2,4.0,1133568000,"As a fan of the old 80's Joe cartoon, I can recall hordes of these 'Green Shrirts' running around in the background. Finally, Hasbro has given the backbone rank-and-file their own figures.On the whole, these six figures are much like any of the others being put out today in the Valor vs. Venom and the new Real American Hero lines in terms of quality. In other words, they are more likely than any other 3 3/4 inch figure to hold up to years of harsh play.As for uniqueness, I'd have liked to see a bit more variety and new equipment. 90% of the weapons in this set are repros from the 80's line- there are only 2 new weapons that I could determine. Even the backpacks are copies and the body molds appear to be retreads as well. However, the head sculpts are new and the helmets, as best as I can tell, are new.

As for the grocery cart situation, you aren't supposed to be putting ANY carriers in the top of carts due to it being unsafe! (whether it clicks in or not) This stroller is lightweight, has adjustable handles and great storage room under the stroller. The carrier base has levels built in so that you can properly install it into your car! It also has a compartment in the middle that can store things that you may need quickly, and also keep the owners manual safe.This stroller is SO easy to fold up, with just one hand and foot! I can hold my son in the other hand while I do it-if needed! That was a big selling point on my part-besides the adjustable handles.I love how you can put the leg rest all the way up, and recline the back all the way down to make this stroller like a carriage so that my baby can go on a ""stroll"" around the neighborhood comfy in just the stroller part, instead of having to be in the carrier. And he can easily fall asleep and I feel safe leaving him in it to finish his nap in the house, when we get back.You definitely MUST at least check this travel system out before deciding on one for yourself.

Like some others, my ES8095 would not take a charge. The first time was in warranty, and was repaired, and then a year later (with new batteries from Amazon) it wouldn't hold a charge for more than two shaves, this time it was out of warranty.This is my third Panasonic shaver, and each one shaves better than the previous one. I like the feel of the ES 8077, it is lighter and fits better in my hand. The Li-ion battery life is excellent. I went a week and a half, and only charged it because it was a convenient time to recharge it. The indicator was still at high.It is too early to say if the cleaning is worthwhile. The cleaning cycle takes nearly 3 hours, and does a very good job. The cost of the cleanning cartridges seem a little high.The other downside of this shaver is that it is no longer induction charging. You can either insert it (snaps easily) into the cleaning stand (electrical contacts at the base of the shaver) or unplug the wall transformer from the cleaning stand and plug it directly into the base of the shaver. I will be watching to see if the electrical contacts corrode over time or leak due to exposure to water.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,toys games,action toy figures,figures

Our oldest son will stand & ride every time. Now we are using it with our Graco carrier, and the boys are facing each other. I would have given it five stars, but when you're using the carrier, it's impossible to access the storage basket (I read where someone had a zipper put in a different stroller's basket, so I might try that), and no cup holder or anything for storage for the parents. It's so easy to maneuver & to fold up. It's not very light, but it's not heavy, either. We love it.

I can tell you, out of all of the other seats I've ever owned, most of which were ""professionally"" installed still slid side to side and front to back no matter how tight the seat belt was. The LATCH system for this seat makes it easy to install (literally minutes as opposed to a half an hour) and if you put your knee into the seat and press your weight into it while tightening the straps, it won't budge. I could literally try to rock the seat and the car would move but not the seat.

My son is in that phase where he just loves to push knobs and buttons so the front and console part of this one really satisfies that desire. When given the choice between this ride on and the Chicco one he tends to go for this one first because of the many things to play with on it. As far as stability, the Nemo wins again so I would have to say that this ride on is hard to beat especially if you have a Nemo fan.",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons,baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

The front wheels do not swivel very well at all. I found myself practically puching the stroller with the feeling as though the wheel were lock and they were not.3 - The basket underneath draggs. you cannot store anything other than a coloring book and small bottle bag. anything more than that the basket is on the floor.5 - The sunshades began to warp slightly.Babies r us is giving me a hard time to return the stroller which I find disappointing since I spend plenty of money there.

I called Anita at Alohaisland and she talked with me and gave me great info on over-extraction, pod brewers, Kona, different roasts. She asked me to hold on the Bunn one more week and she would send me a sample pack with more pods so I could decide. She assured me that the Bunn My Cafe was not the reason I didnt like the Light Roast Kona. Anita was correct! After trying 4 more flavors(Choco Macadamia Nut, Dark Roast, Espresso, and Hazelnut)we loved them all! Finally we had the rich smooth coffee that we had hoped for. If you are not sure which flavor pods to order first, just call Alohaisland, talk with them and they will help you decide. I have loved Dunkin Donuts coffee for years, thinking it was a light roast.

Battery life is good and the cartridges are pretty easy to change. A few times, my son wouldn't have the cartridge in all the way, but a quick, light push & it's all set.

The eel like head and bat type wings seem like two different dragon concepts combined, that don't match well. The coloration, with a bit of camoflage, looks okay on the back, but bad almost everywhere else. This figure has the worse piece to piece color matching of any dragon in series one or two.Mainly, the pose on this dragon is awful. The lack of articulation makes it impossible to improve. This website picture is a LITTLE better than the box shot, as they bent him down a little... giving him a sort of crawling look. Maybe that is what they were going for, and that might have been cool, but it didn't work. In reality this dragon looks like it's dancing, or stomping around in a childish Barney fashion. The one arm and leg positioned up just kill the look of this figure. Also, he's splashing in a textured mudpuddle that might have been cool... but manages to look way too much like dragon poo.This figure really stands out in the series... unfortunately because all the dragons are awesome looking, and this one is hideous and poorly sculpted.",toys games,action toy figures,figures,toys games,electronics for kids,unknown

B0006N8XZK,Grand Canyon Express Remote-Control Train Set - G Scale,A74NZUVWJ7KWT,22/22,4.0,1134604800,"I initially bought this toy train set to use as a stylish Christmas decoration rather than as an operational train set. Primarily I was looking for table top or mantle piece item that would remind me of the train sets I had recieved at Christmas in the late 1940s and early 1950s without costing an arm and a leg. I wanted a set that I could set up, operate, take down, and pack away until next year with a minimum of fuss. This set more than fills that bill. The quality of the pieces is very high considering the modest sales price. The wife and I were so taken by the fit and finish of the set when we opened the box that we decided to go ahead and set the train up running around the tree. It took only a few minutes to set up a simple circular track, install the 6 ""C"" cell batteries in the engine tender, and a 9 volt transistor battery in the radio transmitter remote control. This set comes without batteries so you should make sure you have fresh batteries on hand as the train just won't run with weak or run down older batteries as we found out. The large scale make this an easy item for the bifocal set to manage and the radio based remote control allows easy single speed forward, reverse, and stop operation. There is also a preprogrammed set of train sounds that are triggered by the remote. The smoke stack also emits small puffs of smoke just the same as when I was a child. Very nostalgic. I suspect that playing the train sounds once or twice for guests will be enough for most adults but children who are old enough to be fascinated by loud sounds will really love that feature. Sure got the cat's attention. I bought the extra track at the same time as the train set but the track that comes with the set is sure to be enough for most uses. The only potential downside to this set is the rate of battery consumption. The C cell batteries have to operate the engine motor, the head lamp, the train sounds, and the smoke generator so there is potentially a lot of current drain from those batteries. There is no battery charger provided nor mentioned in the instructions so consumption could be an issue if the set is operated on a fairly continuous basis. Overall I would highly recommend this set for the purposes outlined.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown,toys games,games,board games

I transitioned from an old Norelco 835 whose power plug was starting to give out. The Remington does not shave as close and yields more skin irritation. The actual model itself is pretty sleek and the power button is very good (push it once to turn on/off).

B000A3E3WI,Fisher Price Loving Family Twin Time Dollhouse with Exclusive Bonus Accessories,AW58VP7X8521W,5/6,5.0,1134604800,"This is a quick review since it's almost time for Christmas, I will be back later for a fuller review.I've been waiting to buy a dollhouse for my 3 1/2 yo because she hadn't really been that interested plus she has a sister whose 18mos younger. So I didn't want something with all those little pieces everywhere or little pieces to eat.This set is so nice. Here's what I like.*Bigger pieces & Bigger People. Not too big for little hands, though. Mom is 5 1/2"", Dad is 6"" tall. Their clothes DON'T come off. So no little clothing pieces to be picking up or wasting time dressing them in order to play. Polly's & Bratz & such are nice, but are nice for my older daughter and she can keep little sisters out of her room when playing with her stuff.*People that stand by themselves w/ no help. Even if the feet/legs/back aren't quite right. Which little kids aren't going to get them in perfect alignment. It's cute, you can even bend Dad over at the sink like he's washing his hands and adjust his knees a little and he still stands!! Maybe it's been a long time since I've seen dolls & dollhouses, but this is nice.*Mom and Dad's thighs and knees are articulated well enough that they can sit nicely in the kitchen chair or sofa and not fall off. The thighs move up plenty so that there legs and back end are even. Some dolls I have seen don't bend far enough and they slide out of their chairs.*Food/cups molded onto trays. There are 2 trays. One with 2 cups of coffee/cocoa and such molded onto the tray. The other has a slice of pizza and a soda can molded on. So no little cups or pizza falling off and being lost. The tray's diameter measures almost 1 1/2"". So, that is not as likely to get lost. or possibly eaten by a younger child. But I will probably put those pieces up for a little while longer just to be safe.Since this is recommended for 3+, I wouldn't necessarily buy this for a child under 3. But if you have a 3 yr old and were wondering, these pieces - people and furniture are big enough to not have to fret over you're little one getting ahold of them.*The computer desk has the mouse and computer attached to it. The keyboard is attached to the keyboard holder and only the keyboard holder slides out. I like it alot.I don't forsee us folding up the sides of the house as I will be putting it on a desk for now and keeping it out to play with. So I like the ones that fold up completely and you can put away, but with the other things I listed I think this will do nicely for the time being.I also saw in the store and online, that some of the pieces have strings attached to them so I quess those won't wander off. Like the coffee pot in the kitchen set.I also liked that you can open the dishwasher in that set and put dishes in there or put things in the oven.

I dispatched husband with screwdriver to take the thing apart to free the ""jammed"" diaper.

They also get really excited when in the bouncer and move their legs and sometimes move the seahorse and fish. I now have the setting so that once they hit either the seahorse or fish the display panel makes music or bubbling sounds.--- When they were only a few weeks old the seat was too ramrod straight. I actually put my own weight on the chair to push it down more. The seat belt is weird looking because the fabric portion is so small.I don't know about any safety issues with this chair. It seems pretty sturdy to me. Yesterday we had nieces and nephews over. A couple of toddlers enjoyed sitting in the bouncer and the bouncer held its ground. We have two other bouncers (a safari bouncer) and we like the Aquarium Bouncer the best.

B000132W02,Eddie Bauer Musical Rocking Bassinet,AZUW1NQMP2PAI,4/4,4.0,1135123200,We got a pack and play for our baby to sleep in the bedroom but she would not sleep for longer than twenty minutes. I heard that newborns like to sleep in small spaces so I decided to get a bassinet. This was the only one in the store that I liked - everything else was either overly frilly or cartooney. Now she sleep for hours at a time and even takes naps!! I disagree with the other reviews regarding the safety of this item. The bassinet does lock so it will not tilt if your little one rolls over (mine started to roll to her side at one week). If your baby can roll all the way around it is time to put him or her in a crib! I didn't even bother with the music since musical attachments that come with most baby products sound horrible anyway so I cannot comment on that aspect of the product. One complaint I have with this bassinet is that the cover gets dirty you have to take the whole thing apart to clean it.

A very helpful woman responded and asked for the model number. I gave that to her and she immediately emailed back that she was sending me out a new piece. If I could edit the number of stars I gave this review, I would move it up to a 4 or 5. It is extremely hard to get good service and people to back up their product. My experience with Baby Einstein (Graco) will have me buying from them again.-------------------Had to append the review below. Baby is now 5 months old and has broken the ""hinge"" on the book. I had to take the book off the excersaucer and plan on calling to see if I can get a new one. I'll let you know how the customer service is. Also, Caterpillar Bead Bar is in grave danger of breaking off. I can't believe it hasn't already. She is bending it almost completely backwards at this point.......................................As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the ""legs"" do tend to pop up. But, luckily my baby doesn't skip a beat and doesn't seem to notice or care. I will say that she has bent the bead bar so far back to get it in her mouth that I was sure it would break but so far so good. She really enjoys it and the tray in front is big enough that I can give her something else to play with if she bores with the attached toys. I don't think the toy that makes the animal noise, says it in English and then Spanish is very helpful because I can hardly understand what he is saying in English forget the Spanish version. However she cracks up at the animal sounds. Also, I expect to be the most educational ""toy"" in my daughter's life and only require her toys to entertain her so this works just fine for us!",toys games,baby toddler toys,unknown,baby products,feeding,bottle feeding

You have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way, per the above comment about the directions.- The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly.I think that next year, we'll just stick to Legos.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets,toys games,games,trading card games

Having purchased other Melissa and Doug products over the years with great satisfaction, we assumed that this was another one of their wonderful toys. While the armoire is cute, there are two problems with it:1. It is touted as being sized correctly for 18"" dolls; however, the hanging part of the armoire is too short for most of their clothes. In addition, the hanging section is divided into two narrow areas, each of which is really too skinny to hold more than just a few items of clothing.2. The paint finish does not hold up well to even the most minor usage. When carefully unwrapping the armoire from the packaging, we actually chipped a couple of small areas. Since this item is meant for children to play with, the paint should hold up better than that.Since we have always been happy with Doug and Melissa toys, we assumed that we would be happy with this armoire and didn't conduct our research on it as thoroughly as we would have otherwise. By noting the measurements, we would have hopefully realized that the sizing was not right for an 18"" doll and would have instead purchased a different armoire elsewhere.",toys games,dolls accessories,dollhouse accessories,baby products,safety,gates doorways

The nipples that come with my breast pump tended to collapse on her during meals, and she just couldn't seem to get comfortable on them, since they need a completely different mouth position than nursing. Playtex VentAires to the rescue! (Imagine superhero music playing here.) The VentAire nipples were immediately familiar to my daughter and she was able to nurse well. Not only that, but I noticed that after a few feedings with the VentAire bottles, which encourage a baby to open very wide for the nipple, that her latch when actually nursing was much improved. The bottles had actually gotten her in the habit of opening wide wide wide, much more so than by nursing alone. So I can honestly say that these bottles improved our non-bottle nursing experience as well. I can't say enough good things about this product.

We did as the instructions say and Annabell cried tears the very next time she cried. My daughter sings to her and she stops crying. She also rubs the doll's belly and she stops crying. Loud noises do wake up the doll. We were driving around town and an ambulance passed us and the doll cried. This doll is well worth the money. I love to watch my daughter be so loving to this doll.

Just to let ya' know, her arms are PERMENANTLY bent in the posistion they are in. You can still move them up n' down, but no bending them. I guess it was so she could easily hold her guitar(which is really hard). Her denim capris are folded up once with golden string hemming. There are two little pink frillies running up her white-striped pants. The brown leather belt has pink stitching, and has a silver butterfly pendant on her right hip and 2 silver plus four gold strings hanging off it. Her sandals are made of a 'cork' looking material with maroon blossoms. Her rubbery pink purse has four charms (star, heart, flower, and of course butterfly). Then Barbie's amplifier is REALLY loud. The guitar is attached to the amplifier. When trying to put this doll on display, I just use the amp as a seat. It looks great! Barbie did come with a pencil(which I have yet to sharpen), a diary(which I have yet to write in), and a whole bunch of cheap cardboard magazines(which I just chunked in the garbage).

The only reason I give it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of the lack of software available for it right now. But, I am sure that more is to come. The pen is very easy to use. It tells you exactly what to write, or touch, in order to use all the options. Also, it is very educational. There are lots of games to play and things to do that spark the imagination. My daughter thinks it is great, as well. Even my teenage nephews has a great time with it and would like one of their own!!!! You do have to use the special paper, BUT, once you write or draw something, you can reuse it over and over. For example, if you draw the keyboard and all of the icons, you can use that same piece of paper over and over, instead of re-drawing it each time. It is a little on the expensive side, but compared to a video gaming system, it is actually cheap!! And, you get all the educational value!!!!!

There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids. Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment. Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn't find one as good. (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!) We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn't notice a big difference in smell-control. (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that's pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails. I've knocked off a star since the mechanism isn't that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.

I always dreamed of being thin again someday, but didn't know if it was truly possible. However, I never dreamed I would lose this much weight in only 18 weeks. When I started this journey I weighed a whopping 195 lbs and today I am a slim 135 lbs. Thanks to Lipovarin for being such an amazing product! I recall the afternoon that I went to go pick up my developed ""before"" photos. As I sat in my car pouring over the embarrassing photos, it was a harsh realization that I had let time get the best of me and I desperately needed to get my weight under control. It was painful looking at those photos, nonetheless, it was the spark that I needed and motivated me to get started NOW!!In the beginning I was a bit skeptical to take any type of dietary supplements. However, once I started taking lipovarin I was pleasantly surprised at how much it curbed my appetite. My weakness with food has always been portion sizes. For the first time I felt like I had control over what I ate and how much I ate. I started to eat smaller portions combined with an overall healthier diet and daily exercise and the results are still shocking. Today, I feel much happier, sexier, energetic, and my self-esteem and self-confidence have skyrocketed. More importantly, I'm a better mother and role model for my children.Recently, I attended a meeting with many of my colleagues who had not seen me for a few months. The reaction was amazing. Literally, nobody recognized me and once they did everybody wanted to know the secret to my weight loss. I feel as though I have discovered the fountain of youth and I have been able to turn back the hands of time by about 15 years.It is difficult trying to juggle all of life's daily demands with the pressures of working full-time and raising two young toddlers. But it's just as difficult trying to live life in a body you're not comfortable with either. Lipovarin helped me show that I am living proof that a woman approaching 40 can regain that 20-something body. Today people refer to me as ""tiny,"" ""small,"" and ""skinnie minnie."" These adjectives are uplifting and motivate me to continue on this path for a lifetime. Although this contest has come to an end, for me this is just the beginning.I feel like a butterfly that has hatched from it's cocoon ready to experience all that life has to offer. I am now truly living life to it's fullest and no longer just surviving.....but thriving! Taking lipovarin on a daily basis, I know that I now have control over food and food no longer has control over me.""",health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,beauty,makeup,lips

The NEW MODEL is designed with its battery pack mounted through the crib slats and on the other side of the crib. It is a very clunky design, one of which my daughter can just pull the back of (and does every night)...and then we find it in her bed the next morning with no fish swimming or singing. It has gone from being one of her favorite night time toys to now being totally unfucntional. *****Poor design change****** I hope that they will revert back to the Old Model soon.Before buying, check ebay or a garage sale for an old version of this toy - - - a much better model.

It falls off everytime my daughter opens it. Now she just takes the door off and leaves it off. The other bad thing about this house is that there is no where to store the furniture. The house folds up into itself so nothing can fit inside when the house is closed. My opinion is that it is a poor design. I really think that the manufacturer should have made it so the furniture could fit inside when it's closed. I paid almost $100 for all the furniture and the house and I expected it to at least have room to store the furniture inside.

The newer Mattel dolls have huge heads, pink and purple all over their faces, too many eyelashes painted on, and hardly any ridge left where the upper eyelid used to be. This condition has been getting progressively worse since the early 1980's when the dolls started appearing with slightly bigger heads than the late 1970's versions, over exaggerated eyes (almost insect-like), too many painted eyelashes, ridiculous eye ball coloring (like purple and pink), large quantities of long thin white/sparkled hair that became easily frizzed, and really bad clothing that presented the children with a totally over the top, unrealistic toy, leaving nothing left for the imagination.

The small kitchen is the perfect size for her, as she likes to sit or squat and play anyway. She enjoys pushing the buttons and putting the shapes in the sorter, as well as opening/closing the fridge/oven/microwave doors. The sounds/tunes are enough to catch her attention. She'll play with it for 3-4 minutes, which is enough for her short attention span. Her almost 2-yr-old cousins, however, weren't interested in it for more than a minute, and our 3-yr-old son stops by every now and then to push its buttons to make some noises. My only disappointment is that the fridge door is very flimsy--the 2-yr-old cousin broke it off within minutes after opening it when he tried to sit on the door. It's not broken, but it falls off a lot. If any of the above bothers you, take the advice of the previous review--either splurge and buy a large play kitchen or a real sorter, because this toy is for 'little' toddlers and will probably be worthwhile for about 6 months before your child is ready to do some serious 'pretend' play.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,baby products,car seats accessories,car seats

She has both a long coat and a very prolific downy white undercoat that seemingly sheds 24/7. It's got a cotton ball texture; tufts of it stick out, and if you pull it, you get a pouf of very soft white down that is guaranteed to stick to you and everything in its path.My former regimen was to use a rubber curry brush for the long outer coat, and (the part I hate), an undercoat rake. No matter how much I brush her, I'm covered with hair, and there's a grocery bag FULL of hair. It's an hour to two hour task, and as much as I love my dog, a huge, hairy nuisance!When I got the Furminator, I was impressed with the heft of it. I bought the large size with the idea that it'd be that much less effort (generally speaking, the small size is the cheapest, but it's so small, it would take forever on anything but the smallest or unhairiest dog. And the difference in price between the medium and large is, at most places, only a few bucks. If you're going to invest in the furminator, go for the size that makes the most out of every pass over the dog's coat.)So I tried a few swoops on the dog. And yeah, it resulted in a ton of hair, but if I just run my fingers through her coat, I get pretty much the same result.I got a grocery bag (to store the hair pulled off the comb) and set to work. On the initial combing, it took a little less than the usual hour it does. What was interesting, though, is that I used only the Furminator, not the undercoat rake and curry comb combo I usually use. In that sense, it was less time and effort.The bag, as usual, was full. But the thing that really sold me on the Furminator is how good her coat looked. Very professional looking, like she had just gotten back from the groomer's.Now it's a few days later, and lo and behold, one of the promises the maker of the Furminator made seems to actually be true",pet supplies,cats,grooming,baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills

I also think it's an attractive swing, unlike many of the others out there, with soft fabric and pleasant colors (light green and beige). My son was very entertained by the mirrored mobile and circling animals above his head. He was less entertained by the plastic flowers and rattle on the bar in the front, but as he got older, he did like to hang onto the rings on the bar and flick the flowers around a little. I didn't love that the bar comes off completely; I never really knew what to do with it when not in use, and I wound up putting it on the floor. I wished that it swung to the side like other models, but as other reviewers have said, sometimes it's a good thing to not have a bar in front of the baby to distract him from sleeping.

This is his first experience with a video game system. I do not recommend Lion King as a first game even though it is labeled 3-5 years. This is not an accurate label. In Lion King the child must be able to simultaneously control the joystick and enter button to make Simba jump over water and land successfully. He also needs to start from a precise point to avoid landing in the water. This is my son's first experience with a video game system and he has trouble with controlling and coordinating this movement. He also received the Elmo's World (3-5 yrs) and Dora's Fix-it Adventure (4-6 yrs) games. These games are both much easier and more forgiving than Lion King. Dora & Elmo never die, there aren't any lives, and when they need to jump over something the child only needs to push the enter button. For a child inexperienced with video games and a low tolerance for frustration, I would not start with this game. The concepts are easy...but the controls are too challenging. My son loves Lion King so I'm sure eventually he will love this game, but right now Elmo and Dora are much easier for him to control.",toys games,electronics for kids,systems accessories,toys games,action toy figures,figures

The motion, visuals, and mechanical factor make it a fun toy for kids on the autistic spectrum as well and, surprisingly, even my sensory-sensitive kids seem to like it despite the loudness.I just bought this toy two weeks ago, and it looks as if the company that makes it is trying to address some of the problems mentioned on this site. I noticed that on my ball popper the top portion of the tube, the place where a child would most likely get their arm stuck, snaps together and can be unsnapped if this situation occurs. It would still be possible for a child to get their arm stuck, however, if they took the top portion off or stuck it in the other hole where the balls go down the ramp. They need to have something that allows the whole front of the toy to snap off.They also seem to have made the motor stronger, as the balls in mine do not get stuck but boy, do they go flying. If I don't round them up and put them back in every single ball is gone after about 15 seconds.

When my son was born, he had difficulty latching on and I started to pump everything for him. Within a week the pump was suctioning but not pulling any milk. At first I thought it was me, until I tried a manual pump and expressed 6 oz in 15 minutes.We called the company and they told us to boil the parts again and see if that helped. It worked for 2 oz and then quit again. Called the company again and they said they would ship new pieces to us since it must be a problem with the seal. However, they would not express ship and we had to wait 8 days for the parts. In the meantime, we rented a Medela from the hospital.At this point, I wish we had just rented to begin with. I was so engorged while trying to figure out the pump problem and lost some of my milk supply. Not to mention the stress of thinking something was wrong with me that I could not feed my baby!While it was working it worked well, but that was only for a little while and the company was def. not as responsive as I would hope a company who helps provide food for infants would be.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,toys games,electronics for kids,personal video players accessories

I adore the fact I can velcro the straps out of the way - which makes getting into and out of the car a lot easier too!

The Evenflo Triumph (rated #1 and cheaper than Britax) was horrendous looking and way too bulky... My husband who normally doesn't care about the cosmetic look of things hated it!

B00085EWGA,Marvel Legends-Sentinel Series-Angel Red,A17ZMCYTC61SVI,2/2,4.0,1138233600,"I was happy to see an Angel figure, rather than an Archangel. I mean, I hope they do the Archangel, as well, but this is my first Angel with the feather wings figure.The wings are AMAZING. Simply amazing, and huge. Couldn't be happier with them; they just simply look wonderful.Now, I think the figure itself, wings not counting, looks good. It has an incredible amount of articulation, and it is a good representation of the Angel character. But the joints are ugly. Almost every part (toes, fingers, etc) is jointed, and most joints are then also ball jointed for maximum movement. This is great for display... but, the ball joints in the shoulders and legs are so large they detract from the all over look. The incredible articulation, to me, takes a lot away from the overall display of the figure and I could have done without the ball joints entirely. I have a hard time posing Angel appealingly with the big round joints.The display stand included is awesome, though, as this is definately a figure you want to display 'in flight.' (And it wouldn't have a prayer of standing on its own...)The Sentinal leg included is HUGE and awesomely detailed. I really really wish I could get my hands on all the pieces, but I have neither the money nor the space to buy figure I don't want just to get all the pieces.

I'm so glad I got it. We got our son (3) a Geo Trax set for Christmas and our family and ""Santa"" also got additional pieces. We have a pretty good set up going and the tunnel is a great addition! I like the fact that it is motion activated. After you turn it on by pressing the button on the front, it turns on the light sensors and makes that water wheel spin and make train and nature noises (frogs, chirping, etc) when the train goes through. Because the tunnel sides are fabric, you can have them go on curves or different directions to suite your layout. You need a cross piece (not included) to go in the middle if you want to have a 4-way crossing. It would be nice if the crossing ""arms"" would go up and down automatically, but we just leave them up all the time so that the trains don't run into them.

I figured I was in the market for an updated flat iron so...I have been reading reviews for all of the flat irons. Price wasn't an issue, and honestly I didn't see much of a difference in price vs value. I brought home a Hot Tools flat iron, tried it and hated it! It pulled my hair and was really weird to work with. Tried the Chi, was good, but didn't love it. So I brought it back and decided to go with the pink Remington. I love that it has an automatic turn off in an hour if you forget about it. It displays the degrees digitaly and heats up super fast. It is so easy to manuever and the top isn't hot, so you can use your fingers/both hands to guide the iron and won't burn yourself. Best of all it works great and doesn't pull my hair. It was so smooth going down my hair. I am really glad that I did all of my homework on irons, although what I really learned was expensive doesn't mean that its' better...just more expensive. So I saved money buying the Remington Tourmaline vs a Chi and instead went all out on hair care products(Biosilk) and Hair Mask(Neutrogena Hair mask)etc.. to protect my hair from the heat.

It attracted my attention by innovative idea of combining regular razor with electro-vibration, thus making a hybrid.I'm not impressed with it at all! I don't like it for several reasons. Vibration actually is mostly reflected on a handle so I felt uncomfortable because it was making my hand too shaky and I'm 26 years old and not a drinker! It doesn't cause cuts or burns but it felt really annoying to my hand while shaving and even a few minutes later!Due to a better lubricator-strip it glides better, softer than regular Mach3 but shaving performance is about the same. Handle grip is OK but a bit worse than regular Mach3 because it doesn't have fully rubberized handle bottom. It can be used with Mach3 cartridges, I tested and shaved. While shaving I was concerned about not getting wet its battery compartment.I would rather use it as regular Mach3 razor, with vibration turned off, but would NOT buy another!

When I finally spotted it, I imediately purchased it, took it home and tried it. So, does this razor live up to the hype?When I came home and took the razor out of the package I was glad to see that the battery (1-AAA battery) was included but I was a little put off that it only came with one razor cartridge. I figured from past experience that there would be two but only one??? The razor itself has a decent weight and a nice shape so I quickly got over the fact that there was only one cartridge.I brought the razor in the shower, washed my face and applied my shaving gel and was preparred to be wowed. I turned the razor on and it came to life with a solid hum. The power button on it seems to be better than the M3Power's because it protrudes a little less and it seems less likely to be accidently turned off while you're shaving. That being said, I began to shave. The first thing I noticed about the razor was the size of it's head. It seems rather large in comparison to the M3Power or even the Schick Quattro blades. Even though it did seem bigger, it didn't seem awkwardky big and I was still able to shave without it being cumbersome. The razor cut clean and smoothly though my beard and gave quite a comfortable shave. The blades easily rinsed under running water even though they are spaced quite closely to each other. I noticed on a few of my problem spots I still had to take multiple passes with the razor so in spite of having five blades, it couldn't perform miracles! There was the single trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge too but it really didn't seem to be very functional.Overall I was quite satisfied with the quality and comfort of the shave. The question that I have now is that, in spite of a good shave, is this razor worth the extra price versus say, the M3Power or the Schick Quattro? Locally the refils go for about 30% more than the other ""older"" razors so, there is a signifigant price difference?Personally, I'll continue to use this razor for a little while and look for the cartridges to be on sale but I honestly don't think the Fusion's shave is that far superior to either the M3Power or the Schick Quattro to justify paying that much extra.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,baby products,safety,gates doorways

I've also noticed that when she would fall over (from sitting position) that the bars are well cushioned and she has yet to hurt herself or get upset. This items is a great buy and well made.

I reused the litter catchers to the point that I only bought 1 box of 12 boxes plus the 6 that came with the box.I did try the litter with crystals, and I felt that it worked better than just the clumping litter by itself. I didn't like the one that was crystals by themselves. but mixing Tidy cats with crystals (before they did it themselves) worked well.So I say it was a pretty good choice, except when it got hung up if I filled it too full or other reasons. I recomend getting the tent and the ramp to, to keep the scatter down to a managable area.Why don't I still have it?

The more you shake it the further it goes. They have banged against furniture and walls going full speed and they have held up pretty good considreing they are being played by two kids. The toys age is for 3 and older but my son is one and he loves crawling after the car just to shake it and go after it again. They are not tiny like other toy cars so even when they are running they are unlikely to run in small places like under the fridge and if they do run under furniture they are easy to grab hold off. Another feature is that you can turn it off by moving a switch underneath the car so if you are traveling it will not just turn on.

But, K-Y Warming Jelly is a newer product. It has a certain something in it that causes it to give a mild warming feeling on contact - this can be quite nice if you are prone to feeling cold, as I am.Overall, I found this to be a pretty good lubricant, and I liked the warming properties. Now, among its ingredients is ""Acacia Honey,"" and some people say that it is more likely to cause a yeast infection than regular water-based lubricants. I haven't heard one way or another from anyone authoritative, and haven't experienced a yeast infection since I started using it, but you might want to keep that in mind. The worst downside to me, though, is the taste. If you use this stuff, and then get it into your mouth, you will find it to have an odd, bitter taste that is probably the ingredient trying to ""warm"" your tongue.So, I would say that this is a pretty good lubricant, one with a bad taste.

I have to make sure I am not running low. Not a huge issue, because the liners last- I usually place an order when I get to my last liner refill and have plenty of time to receive it via regular shipping. Despite the fact I have only had to order one box of refills since baby was born, it's still inconvenient.* While the pedal/trap door disposal is super convenient, I find it only works properly if the bag inside is empty and the diaper I am tossing is fairly heavy. When my baby was a newborn, I had to push the diaper through the trapdoor- the diapers, even soiled, we not heavy enough to fall through the trap door. And if the bag is half full, it might just fall in half way- so you have to give it a push in, down towards a bunch of dirty diapers...eeeww...Annoying.* This one has been mentioned before",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills,beauty,fragrance,men s

I found that the lotion works better. Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results.The shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer. The triple blades make it difficult to get under above your lip and I seem to have to get a disposible razor to get right under the nose. It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave.

B00005V6C8,Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,A2UDGUP80JVKBO,2/2,5.0,1139184000,"This diaper pail is great! I read a few other reviews and would like to comment based on them.Our son will be 5 months old this week. He was exclusively breastfed, then had formula added to his diet, and now also eats jarred foods. Regardless of what he eats and what his ""output"" is, as long as you close the diaper the way you should, this pail holds in odors just as well as any other diaper disposal system does.I personally think the design is ingenious! The liner sets in the top of the pail and you pull it through to the bottom and make a knot in the bottom. To dispose of the diapers, you just step on a pedal. The top lifts up, you drop the diaper, and it falls through the ""flaps."" When it's full, you open the door on the front and cut the liner off (there is a liner-cutter in the door). You are totally in control of how much liner you use and therefore don't have to waste or have a huge portion of liner that is unfilled. Then you just tie a new knot and pull the liner down to fill the pail, and you're ready to start again! The system comes with one liner refill, and refills are sold 3 to a pack (I see them all the time at my Babies 'R' Us, and my Babies 'R' Us almost never has anything in stock!). We are on the first refill in the first pack. We had bought 2 packs of refills when we got the system, and I seriously wonder if we will ever need to purchase another one...or if we'll even use all of what we bought!One reviewer stated that the system should tell you when the bag is about to run out because you could be tossing your diaper into the pail w/out a liner. I'm really not sure how that would ever happen, as you are the one who has to open the side of the pail to remove the full bag and pull down the new liner. If you go to pull down the liner and it you hit the end of the refill...well, it's like saying you don't know when your paper towel roll comes to an end. You pull and there is no more.Someone also commented on the flaps, and how the diapers don't fall through. I disagree with that. Regardless of my son's age, as long as he urinated more than once in his diaper and there was any kind of weight to it at all, it would fall through. Only if it was completely dry would it not fall through. And even then, if you just take your foot off the pedal and let the top fall down, it would push it through anyway. The one area I do agree with that person in, though, is that when the pail starts filling up, if you really want to maximize the liner and not change it right away, you DO have to push down on the top diaper to get it to go down far enough for the flaps to close again. But I have never touched another dirty diaper doing this, and I think that it's still worth not having to reach down and lift and push and twist, like you do with the Diaper Genie.There were also comments on refilling the liner. No, it is not as simple as dropping a bag in, like you would a regular trash can. But it most certainly is not complicated. There is a drawing that shows you how to do it, and once it's done, you won't be doing it again for months. Also, when you change the liner, it is SO easy to take the top pieces apart to clean them. I think it's very easy to keep this system clean & sanitary.All that said, if you're looking for the easiest possible route to dispose of dirty diapers, use your regular garbabe can and take the trash out frequently! If you're looking for a disposal system so you don't have to worry about constantly getting dirty diapers out of your house, I'd really have to say this one is the way to go!",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills,toys games,action toy figures,figures

She now sits in it at the table without the tray to eat meals.

Honestly, although it was good, it wasn't any better than Kolestral at a fraction of the price. Kolestral works best when you work it and warm it up with your hands and then massage it all over your scalp and then put some extra on the ends. Let it sit a few minutes (maybe while you shave your legs) and then rinse thoroughly. I use Kolestral very regularly along with a regular light conditioner.

B00085EWH4,Marvel Legends Sentinel Series Figure,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,0/0,3.0,1139961600,"Omega Red, from Russia's version of the Weapon X program is a tentacled titan with a ""death factor"" mutant ability. This ambiguously named power, um, causes you to... die, I guess. But hey, he's a big red dude with tentacles who kicks the X-Men around some so that's cool.He's got a big and solid sculpt although a little flat from back to front for some reason. He's tall and has big feet. He's hard to pose though as any real action pose with the tentacles out from his body seems to weigh him down and cause him to fall. It may just be my figure but he has a hard time balancing. On the up side I did get him into a crouch with his tentacles wrapped around Nightcrawler from the previous series while Nightcrawler kicked him in the face and that was pretty cool but the center of gravity was centered well. Mine has been a mixed bag on posing.Also, and again, maybe its just mine, but the paint on the armor is not very solid. The red is very faded on the shoulders. All in all the figure did not impress me as much out of the package. He dose have plenty of articulation though and his tentacles fit snuggly into his wrists and are removeable.As you have your choice of him or Mystique as both come with the same piece of the mutant killing 16"" Sentinel (5 stars!)

Wow! I was very impressed. Although there are times that I don't feel quite as dry under the arms as I did with my old product (which has antiprespirant), I don't have any odor even after a full day of active work. This suprised me because I struggle to find products that work for me due to my body going through normal cycle changes. These changes often render some of the deodorants that I have tried to be completely ineffective. The best part is that this product is completely scent-free which means that I don't smell like a purfume counter. Now I can use the scented lotions for my skin which don't interfere with the scent of a deodorant (Example - Like when baby powder deodorant and cucumber melon lotion really don't smell great together) Best of all, one stick really does last for many months which means saving some money over the course of a year. I had no problems with application. Any sticking can be easily corrected by properly moistening the rock or moistening the area of application. Can be used on both underarms and feet. I recommend trying this product.",health personal care,personal care,deodorants antiperspirants,baby products,safety,gates doorways

We thought he would love the Roundhouse, but this is the least played with item in his collection. In fact, I can't say that I've seen him play with it more than a couple of times and never for long. He'd much rather spend his time moving his trains around the tracks and over mountains and bridges (a much better way to spend your Thomas money, if you ask me). This piece is overpriced for what it is and you really need the round-about turntable to go with it (so, add an additional thirty to the cost). It is well constructed like all of the other Thomas & Friends wooden pieces by Learning Curve, which is why I gave it 2 stars.So...gauge your child's interest before purchase by watching how he or she plays. Your little conductor might have you spend the money on other items (mountains, extra tracks, a water tower, etc.) than on this piece. I know the Roundhouse is one we could live without, though maybe my son will develop an interest in it later.

We recently got a butcher block in our kitchen and this is the first item I put there, not only as a conversation piece...but as a handy tool within arm's reach when I don't feel like killing myself with the cleaning of one pot or pan for 20 minutes. The only negative comment i've got, regarding this apparatus, is the fact that we pollute the environment with dead batteries when it's time to change 'em.Being such a small item, you can stick it in your kitchen drawer, cabinet or just about anywhere. I don't know how long it will be, before the scrubbers wear out & we end up tossing the thing in the utility closet...but it's cute, practical & inexpensive. I got mine when it was 50% off, at HOME DEPOT. So...it's not like I lost lots of $$$ whilst purchasing it. The thing comes in handy too, when you have a wine or sauce stain on the countertop and you don't want to waste time rubbing in circles with a sponge or scouring pad, over the same surface for a few minutes. It won't do the job of your own arm & some elbow grease, but it certainly does make my dishwashing job easier & adds a little humor to the boring chore of standing at the sink by myself.The device requires 4 AA batteries, which are included. At least mine came with the batteries...and they are B&D; brand batteries. There are 2 scouring pad attachments and 1 blue-bristled scrub-brush. Some people may find the item noisy. It's all a matter of taste. Personally, i like the item and will continue using it, as it's made by B&D.; B&D;'s products have always lived up to the Brand name.Makes a great gag gift too...and most definitely has to be a door prize at any banquet or party.",health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning,toys games,dolls accessories,dolls

B000BUUVTE,Gillette Fusion Manual Razor,A3PE7YRXC8OFJ9,5/6,2.0,1140393600,"Four words, over priced, over hyped. When compared with my old razor, the differences between shaving experiences were minimal at best.For one week, I shaved one side of my face and head with the Fusion, and the other side with my regular razor, the Schick Xtreme 3. I am black, with tough beard hair, a shaved head, and a fumanchu moustache. I shave in the shower and wash my face before shaving.If you shave your face and head, I recommend you skip this razor. For shaving the back of the head, the balance of the razor is awkward at best. For shaving the rest of the head, it was no better then any other good blade.For shaving the face, the balance was good, but that was about it. There was no difference in irritation between the two blades. The lubricating strip faded to white after about four shaves, meaning you are no longer getting what Gillette calls an ""optimal shaving experience.""I tried to trim the chin area between my fumanchu moustache. It did a horrible job, no matter how careful I was and the area was left feeling extremely irritated.Consider the Mach 3 over this razor.

If you have a really bad diaper, you just open it up cut and tie. The smell goes outside and you have waisted no bags in doing so. If you wait a week to change it, there is no diaper pail that will ever be that magical.

When we picked it up at the Union Square babies'r us store the box was taped on the side, so I asked if this was returned by another customer, I got a very big ""NO"" and a very convincing explanation that it just happened to crack open on that side as they were pulling it up for us, so they put tape on it. Anyhow, I accepted the explanation as a reasonable one... Now we open it up and we are missing several critical items, the instructional sheet (we could get it from the First Years website anyhow), we are also missing the storage basket, the long screws, the locking nuts, the wheels and mostly OUR PATIENCE! Word of advice, at the risk of seeming petty, never accept a taped up box no matter what, even if a factory sealed box happens to also miss parts, we will not risk it again.
